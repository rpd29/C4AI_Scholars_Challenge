        "\n",
        "In this takehome, you will be working on a problem involving singular value decomposition. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) exists for every rectangular matrix. The nice thing about SVD is that the original matrix can be expressed as the sum of outer products of left and singular vectors scaled by the corresponding singular values. Formally:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Let 𝛢 be a rectangular matrix of dimensions 𝑚𝘹𝑛, then the SVD of the matrix A is given by $ A = U𝛴V^T$ where $U$ is an orthogonal matrix of shape mxm containing the left singular vectors, $V$ is an orthogonal matrix of shape nxn containing the right singular vectors and $𝛴$ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of $A$. This formulation of SVD can be re-expressed as \\begin{align} A = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} s_i. u_i v_i^T \\end{align} where $r = \\text{min}(m,n)$ represents the rank of the matrix, $s_i$ is the $i$th singular value and $u_i v_i^T$ is the outer product of the $i$th left and right singular vectors. \n",

        "\n",
        "> The singular values $𝛴$ are decreasing in order. So, each outer product is scaled by a smaller value as we compute each term in the sum above. This gives us an opportunity to approximate $A$ using only the sum of the first $k$ outer products where $k < \\text{min}(m,n)$ $-$ this effectively means that we are zero-ing out some of the singular values by assuming that the contribution to the sum is negligible. This is called low-rank approximation.\n",

        "#### Answer: \n",
        "\n",
        "One real-world application of low rank approximations is (lossy) data compression. In particular, if a dataset can be represented as a matrix, then low rank approximation can be used to find another matrix that is “close” to the original matrix (where the “distance” between the matrices is measured by the Frobenius norm) but that can be represented more compactly/using less space than the original matrix. For example, an image can typically be represented as a matrix (or a collection of matrices). Low rank approximation can be used to find an image that is “close” to the original image (perhaps even indistinguishable to the human eye) but that can be represented much more compactly, and therefore occupy less space in memory or persistent storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another real-world application of low rank approximation is de-noising. Consider again an image whose data can be represented as a matrix of numbers. The image data may be somewhat “noisy” due to, for example, electronic noise in the circuits of the camera that captured it. One potential way to “denoise” the image is to: (1) compute the singular value decomposition of the image matrix, (2) identify the largest/most important singular values, and (3) compute a low-rank approximation to the original matrix using only these largest singular values and the corresponding left and right singular vectors. The assumption of this approach to denoising is that the smallest singular values and their corresponding rank-1 matrices represent the “noise” in an image and should therefore be eliminated (this assumption may not be true, however, if there is a lot of noise relative to “signal” in the image).\n",

        "\n",
        "When using a neural network in an application (e.g. as part of a robot’s perceptual system, in a content selection algorithm, in a text generation algorithm, etc.), there are several things that relevant stakeholders (e.g. users, a company’s shareholders, society at large etc.) might care about, including: \n",
        "\n",
        "1) Inference latency (i.e. how long it takes to execute a single inference). For example, an autonomous car needs to be able to quickly react to changes in its environment, so it's important that it is able to quickly process raw perceptual data and make decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Inference throughput (i.e. how many inferences a system can execute per unit of time). For example, a website that enables people to generate images from text may want to be able to service the requests of large numbers of users simultaneously, in which case the people developing the website might care about inference throughput (including increasing inference throughput without needing to add significant additional computational resources). \n",
        "\n",
        "3) Computational costs and environmental impact. People and organizations typically prefer to minimize the amount of money/resources they need to spend to achieve a given goal/result. Additionally, people and organizations might care about minimizing/reducing any negative impact their activities have on the environment. As a result, people and organizations using neural networks may care about reducing the computational resources and energy required to do inference, which would in turn reduce the costs and environmental impact associated with using them. Using more efficient algorithms that require fewer and/or less expensive/energy intensive operations can reduce both costs and environmental footprint. In addition, costs can also be reduced by reducing the amount of persistent storage required to store the code and data associated with a program/application (including, for example, information about the weights and architecture of a neural network the program uses). \n",
        "\n",
        "4) Quality of the inferences/predictions. Typically the point of using a neural network (or any other sort of model) is to make useful predictions about some aspect of the world (e.g. which content a user of a social media platform is most likely to engage with, what are the most likely future trajectories of a pedestrian crossing the road, which moves in a game of chess are the most likely to lead to a win, etc.). Given this, the quality/accuracy of the predictions a neural network makes greatly affects its utility to users.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Compressing deep neural networks can potentially help improve all of the above things. First, compressing a neural network can potentially enable lower latency inference. In particular, inference using a compressed representation of a neural network may require fetching less data from memory, which may significantly speed up inference given how slow memory references can be. Additionally, if the same neural network is used multiple times in quick succession, later inferences might be faster than the first inference if more of the data needed to execute subsequent inferences (e.g. the network weights) is located higher in the memory hierarchy than it was when the first inference was executed (e.g. in L1, L2, or L3 cache versus in main memory). Using a compressed representation of a neural network could help to facilitate this, since a larger fraction of the data associated with the neural network may fit in higher levels of the memory hierarchy, and a smaller fraction of it would need to be replaced/swapped out between inferences. Additionally, in some cases neural network compression can reduce the number of arithmetic operations required to conduct inference, which can further reduce inference latency. Reducing inference latency would also increase inference throughput (though the reverse is not always true). \n",
        "\n",
        "Compressing a deep neural network can also potentially reduce the costs and environmental impact associated with using it. From what I understand, memory references tend to be significantly more energy intensive than other types of operations. By reducing the memory references required to use a neural network, compression could potentially significantly reduce the energy neural network inference consumes. In cases where neural network compression reduces the number of arithmetic operations required to do inference, this would further reduce the computational and energy resources required to use the neural network. In addition, compressing a neural network by definition reduces the amount of space it occupies in persistent storage, which can further reduce costs associated with using it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Last, compressing a deep neural network may potentially help select better models that will make higher quality/more accurate predictions. In particular, a common concern in machine learning and statistics is that in some cases a model fits observations/data well not because it identifies general patterns in the structure of the data, but rather because it in some sense “memorizes” the data (this phenomenon is sometimes called “overfitting”). For example, a model might have a separate narrowly applicable rule accounting for each individual observation rather than a single more general rule that seems to account well for all observations. The worry is that a model that overfits observations may not generalize well beyond the situations in the training data, since the components of an overfit model that cause it to fit observations well are narrow patterns that are highly specific/local to one or a small number of observations, rather than more general patterns that match the global structure of the data. In other words, an overfit hypothesis doesn’t even identify patterns that generalize within the situations in the training data, so you might reasonably expect that such a hypothesis is unlikely to generalize to novel situations. \n",
        "\n",
        "One way to reduce the risk of overfitting is to penalize models with higher “descriptive complexity” in the learning/training/model selection process (roughly speaking, the “descriptive complexity” of a hypothesis is the minimum number of symbols required to precisely describe it in some formal language (e.g. a computer programming language like Python)). The theory/intuition underlying this approach is that models with low descriptive complexity (i.e. models that can be described in a small number of symbols) are less likely to overfit data than models with high descriptive complexity since there is less “descriptive space” in which to fit a lot of narrow/local rules in lower descriptive complexity models. As a result, if two models fit data/observations equally well but one has significantly lower descriptive complexity, it might make sense to select/use (or more heavily weight) the model with lower descriptive complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to penalize models with higher descriptive complexity in the training process, you need some way to measure a model’s descriptive complexity. In particular, you need to: (1) select a formal language to use to describe models, and (2) if there are multiple ways of describing a model in that language, you need to decide which of these descriptions should be used to measure the model’s descriptive complexity. A natural rule for (2) is to use the length of the shortest (i.e. the most “compressed”) description of the model (which is sometimes called the “Kolmogorov complexity” of the model) as a measure of its descriptive complexity, since longer descriptions might contain redundant/extraneous/unnecessary symbols (e.g. the expressions f(x) = x and f(x) = x + 5 - 3 - 2 + 100 - 90 - 10 both describe the same function, but the second description has several unnecessary symbols). Unfortunately, however, it turns out that there is no general algorithm that can be used to find the length of the shortest description of a model. As a result, the best that can be done in practice is to use computable compression algorithms to try to approximate the descriptive complexity of a model. Lossless neural network compression techniques may therefore be useful when trying to approximate the descriptive complexity of different neural networks, which may in turn help to identify neural networks that have a better chance of generalizing well beyond the training data. \n"

In particular, I’ll compare the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches with respect to the characteristics of neural network inference that I identified in my response to the previous question (inference latency and throughput, computational costs and environmental impact, and quality of inferences/predictions). There are many different variations of pruning (e.g. you can prune any combination weights, neurons, or layers, you can reinitialize weights after after pruning and before retraining or you can retrain starting from the old weights, etc.) and quantization (e.g. you can replace 32 bit floating point numbers with either 16 bit floating point numbers or 8 bit integers, you can do quantization post-training or do “quantization-aware” training, etc.).

However, pruning that only prunes weights only enables compression if: (1) the pruning process results in sparse weight matrices, and (2) the sparse weight matrices are represented using specialized data structures (e.g. compressed sparse row) that exploit their sparsity to enable compression. However, the data structures used to compress sparse matrices are often not well-suited to exploiting the single instruction multiple data (SIMD) parallelism of GPUs when doing matrix multiplication. As a result, on GPUs sparse matrix multiplication algorithms sometimes run slower than dense matrix multiplication algorithms (which are very well-suited to exploiting the SIMD parallelism of GPUs) for matrices with comparable dimensions. So while weight pruning may enable significant model compression, in some cases GPU-based inference using the compressed representations of the weight matrices may not be faster (and may in fact be slower) than inference using the original weight matrices (though from what I understand this depends in part on how sparse the weight matrices are after pruning, with extremely sparse matrices sometimes enabling faster inference). As a result, pruning only weights may not actually result in a substantial improvement in inference latency or throughput. \n",

Because dense matrix multiplication algorithms are better-suited to exploiting the SIMD parallelism of GPUs than sparse matrix multiplication algorithms, in some cases low-rank approximation techniques may enable a greater improvement in inference latency and throughput for the same level of compression versus weight-only pruning when inference is being done on GPUs.\n",

Another way of putting this is that for a weight matrix of rank k, there are only k ways of approximating this matrix via low-rank approximation (essentially the only choice you have is what you want the rank of the approximating matrix to be). In contrast, pruning allows you to choose any subset of the weights in a matrix to zero out, and also allows you to eliminate entire weight matrices or rows of weight matrices. Moreover, pruning allows you to target what exactly you prune based on estimates how much pruning something will impact the training loss (e.g. you can compute the partial derivative of the loss with respect to each weight parameter and then only eliminate weights where this partial derivative is small). The fact that pruning is more flexible than low-rank approximation (in the sense that there will typically be many more ways of achieving a given level of compression via pruning than via low-rank approximation) combined with the fact that pruning can be done in a targeted fashion suggests that pruning may in many cases enable higher quality inferences/predictions for a given level of compression than low-rank approximation.\n",

If this happens, these higher-rank retrained weight matrices would then need to be approximated using singular value decomposition again to achieve the same level of compression. It is perhaps an interesting research question whether this cycle of low rank approximation→retraining→low rank approximation would produce compressed neural networks that make higher quality predictions than simply doing low rank approximation once, but it isn’t obvious to me that it would.

        "Plot the relationship of time (y-axis) vs rank percentage (x-axis). To do so add code to compute the ranks_and_times list.\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: No, replacing the linear layer weight matrices with low rank approximations does not seem to reduce latency. This is not surprising, since the code is simply replacing the original linear layer weight matrices with low rank approximations to those matrices that are the same size/dimension. In other words, the code is not actually using a compressed representation of the linear layer weight matrices, so we would not expect a reduction in latency (since the number of memory references and arithmetic operations required to execute inference will be approximately the same for the network with the original weight matrices and the network with the low rank approximations). \n",
        "\n",
        "One caveat to note is that the first time the evaluation code is run, the latency for the network using the full weight matrices appears to be significantly higher than the latency for all of the networks using the low rank approximations (but the latency appears to be roughly the same for all of the networks low rank approximations). I suspect this is due to the fact that the network with the full rank weight matrices is run first, and the first time this network is used for inference there may be significant overhead associated with fetching code/data needed to run the network other than the linear layer weights (e.g. code/data related to the network architecture, the convolutional layer weights, etc.) from lower levels of the memory hierarchy. This overhead may then be significantly reduced for all subsequent inferences that reuse some of this code/data (since the code/data may already be in higher levels of the memory hierarchy and therefore may be much faster to fetch), which would include all of the evaluations of the lower rank approximations. Notably the difference in latency between the network that uses the full rank weight matrices and the networks that use the lower rank weight matrices appears to disappear when the evaluation code is run for the second time in a row, which would be consistent with the above hypothesis.

        "Latency tends to decrease as the rank fraction of the linear layer weight matrices decreases. This makes sense, since the code above uses the factorized matrices for inference, so the lower rank approximations will tend to have linear layer weight matrices with a smaller overall memory footprint than higher rank approximations (and therefore will tend to require less memory references for inference).\n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly, it seems like latency tends to be higher for networks using factorized linear layer weight matrices for inference than for networks that use non-factorized weight matrices until the rank fraction gets quite low (e.g. less than 0.5). For rank fractions below 0.5, it seems like the latency for factorized networks tends to be less than for any of the non-factorized networks, but at the cost of significantly lower accuracy. Perhaps these patterns are due in part to the fact that for high rank fractions it is possible for the factorized matrices to actually have a collectively larger memory footprint than the equivalent non-factorized matrix (it may also take more arithmetic operations to multiply a vector by the factorized matrices than the equivalent non-factorized matrix for high rank fractions).
